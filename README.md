# Project CarND-LaneLines-P1

In this project, a lane line detect pipline is implemented. In the pipline some basic computer vision algorithms are used, such as Canny edge detect and Hough Line detect. The input contains images and videos. The output are images or videos annotated with left anf right lane line.
